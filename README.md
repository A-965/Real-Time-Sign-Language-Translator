A deep learning-based real-time sign language recognition system built with PyTorch, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. This project uses computer vision and neural networks to translate American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into text in real-time.

🎯 Features
Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe
Deep learning models with LSTM and Attention mechanisms
Temporal sequence modeling for gesture recognition
Live webcam integration with OpenCV
Confidence scoring and prediction smoothing
Extensible architecture for adding new sign classes
GPU acceleration support

🏗️ Architecture
The system consists of several key components:
Hand Detection: MediaPipe-based hand landmark extraction
Feature Engineering: Advanced feature extraction from hand landmarks
Neural Networks: LSTM and Attention-based models for sequence classification
Real-time Processing: Optimized pipeline for live video processing

📊 Performance
The model's performance depends heavily on the quality and size of the training dataset. With the sample random data:

Training Accuracy: ~45% (on random data)
Validation Accuracy: Low (expected for random data)
Real-time FPS: 15-30 FPS (depending on hardware)
