A deep learning-based real-time sign language recognition system built with PyTorch, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. This project uses computer vision and neural networks to translate American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into text in real-time.

üéØ Features
Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe
Deep learning models with LSTM and Attention mechanisms
Temporal sequence modeling for gesture recognition
Live webcam integration with OpenCV
Confidence scoring and prediction smoothing
Extensible architecture for adding new sign classes
GPU acceleration support

üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The system consists of several key components:
Hand Detection: MediaPipe-based hand landmark extraction
Feature Engineering: Advanced feature extraction from hand landmarks
Neural Networks: LSTM and Attention-based models for sequence classification
Real-time Processing: Optimized pipeline for live video processing

üìä Performance
The model's performance depends heavily on the quality and size of the training dataset. With the sample random data:

Training Accuracy: ~45% (on random data)
Validation Accuracy: Low (expected for random data)
Real-time FPS: 15-30 FPS (depending on hardware)

üîß Customization
Adding Your Own Dataset
Replace the create_sample_data() function in main.py:

python
Download
Copy code
def load_real_dataset():
    """Load your actual sign language dataset"""
    sequences = []  # List of landmark sequences
    labels = []     # Corresponding labels
    class_names = ['hello', 'thank_you', 'please', ...]  # Your classes
    
    # Your data loading logic here
    
    return sequences, labels, class_names
Modifying Model Architecture
Edit model.py to experiment with different architectures:

Change LSTM hidden dimensions
Add more layers
Modify attention mechanisms
Add dropout for regularization
Adjusting Real-time Parameters
In real_time_translator.py:

python
Download
Copy code
translator = RealTimeSignLanguageTranslator(
    model_path='best_model.pth',
    class_names=class_names,
    sequence_length=30,           # Adjust sequence length
    confidence_threshold=0.7      # Adjust confidence threshold
)

üêõ Troubleshooting
Common Issues
MediaPipe Installation Error

Download
Copy code
ERROR: No matching distribution found for mediapipe
Solution: Use Python 3.8-3.11. MediaPipe doesn't support Python 3.12+.

Webcam Not Opening

Check if another application is using the webcam
Try changing the camera index in cv2.VideoCapture(0) to cv2.VideoCapture(1)
Low FPS Performance

Reduce input resolution
Use GPU acceleration if available
Optimize the sequence buffer size
Import Errors

Ensure all dependencies are installed in the active environment
Check Python interpreter selection in your IDE
Performance Optimization
GPU Usage: The model automatically uses CUDA if available
Frame Skipping: Process every nth frame for better performance
Model Quantization: Use PyTorch's quantization for faster inference
